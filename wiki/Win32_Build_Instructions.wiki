= How to build Aliwal Geocoder on Windows =

  * Install the Subversion command line client. I grabbed: [http://www.sliksvn.com/en/download Slik SVN 1.5.3, 32 bit (Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista)]
  * Install Java. I installed [http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/?intcmp=1281 Java SE Development Kit (JDK) 6 Update 10]
  * Install Ant. I grabbed [http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi apache-ant-1.7.1-bin.zip], ran through the wizard and fiddled with the environment as detailed in the install instructions
  * Install NSIS, the Nullsoft Scriptable Install system. I grabbed [http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download 2.4.0] and ran through the install wizard.
  * Check out the Aliwal Geocoder source code by opening a command prompt and running:
  `svn checkout http://aliwal.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ aliwal-read-only`
  * Still at the command prompt, change down to the build directory and run  
  `ant dist_win32`
  * If all goes well you'll see "BUILD SUCCESSFUL" and there will be an installer file called something like "Aliwal Geocoder 0.0.8 Installer.exe" in the .\build\win32\ directory.
  * Any problems, drop me an email and I'll do my best to help.
