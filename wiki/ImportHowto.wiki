A walkthrough showing how to get your data on and Excel spreadsheet and into Aliwal Geocder.

= Details =
== Step 1 ==
Start with a spreadsheet, 1 row per map pin, whatever columns you'd like plus one column for addresses. For best results, the parts of the address should be comma separated and on 1 line, like _123 Streetname, Townname, Country_. Save that spreadsheet as a text file (Tab delimited)(*.txt)

== Step 2 ==
From the Aliwal Geocoder main menu, choose _Import Text File_ and select the text file created in the previous step.

== Step 3 ==
The wizard will prompt for details of the file being imported. Step through the wizard and choose:
  # Delimited columns
  # Tab
  # _Nothing_. This bit only applies if your data already has coordinate columns
  # Move _Country_ and _Town_ out of the right column by selecting them and then clicking the _<<_ button.

  # Leave the _Pin Label & Popup_ details as suggested
  # Move _Type, Lane_ and _Country_ to the right using the _>>_ button and then click the _Finish_ button

== Step 4 ==
Click OK to clear the _Geocoding Errors_ warning. This warning means that some records couldn't be converted from addresses into coordinates. This will be covered later.
