> ## Your data, on a map ##

This tool pins your data onto a map, helping you visualize the _where_ factor. No need to upload your data to an internet map, bring the map to your data instead.

You don't need coordinates either, **Aliwal Geocoder** can figure them out from regular addresses. Start with global satellite image and then zoom in to street level details. Each map pin has popup balloon filled with the details you choose. Tags provide filtering, to help you slie and dice your maps.

It's easy to get your information into **Aliwal Geocoder**, it can work with coordinates or addresses. It can [import](http://code.google.com/p/aliwal/wiki/ImportHowto) text files from Excel or read [KML](http://earth.google.com/) files . There's even an example query for [SQL Server](http://code.google.com/p/aliwal/wiki/SQLServerHowto) experts.
