OSX
====================
Make sure the debug box on on1map.html is commented out
cd into ./build/osx
delete everything, but don't rm -rf coz that might clobber subversion.
svn update
./build_osx.sh
That will create  "Aliwal Geocoder.app"
tar & zip that up with a version number in the archive name. tar -czvf "Aliwal Geocoder v003.app.tar.gz" "Aliwal Geocoder.app"
upload that to http://code.google.com/p/aliwal/downloads/list 
	with tags like 			"Featured,Type-Archive,OpSys-OSX,alpha"
	description like 		"OSX Alpha release v003"
deprecate the old release by adding the deprecated tag and removing the featured tag



WIN
==========================
From explorer, SVN update trunk
cd into \src\trunk\build
ant patch_number
ant clean
ant win32_dist
This will create  Aliwal Geocoder xxx Install.exe
Upload to code.google.com with tags like "Featured,Type-Installer,OpSys-Windows,alpha"
		and description like "Win Alpha release v003"
deprecate the old release by adding the deprecated tag and removing the featured tag
