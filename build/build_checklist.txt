OSX
====================
Make sure the debug box on on1map.html is commented out
cd into ./build/osx
delete everything, but don't rm -rf coz that might clobber subversion.
svn update
./build_osx.sh
That will create  "Aliwal Geocoder.app"
tar & zip that up with a version number in the archive name. tar -czvf "Aliwal Geocoder v003.app.tar.gz" "Aliwal Geocoder.app"
upload that to http://code.google.com/p/aliwal/downloads/list 
	with tags like 			"Featured,Type-Archive,OpSys-OSX,alpha"
	description like 		"OSX Alpha release v003"
deprecate the old release by adding the deprecated tag and removing the featured tag



WIN
==========================
From explorer, SVN update trunk
cd into \src\trunk\build\win
.\build.cmd and (A)l the two prompts.
This will create  Aliwal Geocoder Install.exe
Rename it to  Aliwal Geocoder v003 Install.exe
Upload to code.google.com with tags like "Featured,Type-Installer,OpSys-Windows,alpha"
		and description like "Win Alpha release v003"
deprecate the old release by adding the deprecated tag and removing the featured tag
