OSX
====================
Make sure the debug box on on1map.html is commented out
cd into ./build/osx
delete everything, but don't rm -rf coz that might clobber subversion.
svn update
./build_osx.sh
That will create  "Aliwal Geocoder.app"
tar & zip that up with a version number in the archive name. tar -czvf "Aliwal Geocoder v003.app.tar.gz" "Aliwal Geocoder.app"
upload that to http://code.google.com/p/aliwal/downloads/list 
	with tags like 			"Featured,Type-Archive,OpSys-OSX,alpha"
	description like 		"OSX Alpha release v003"
deprecate the old release by adding the deprcated tag and removing the featured tag
